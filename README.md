    def __init__(self, api_url="http://localhost:8000"):
        self.api_url = api_url
    
    def create_project_breakdown(self, project_description):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.api_url}/generate-tasks",
            json={"project_description": project_description}
        )
        return response.json()
    
    def assign_tasks_to_team(self, breakdown, team_members):
        # Custom logic to assign generated tasks to actual team members
        assignments = {}
        for role, tasks in breakdown["role_tasks"].items():
            if role in team_members:
                assignments[team_members[role]] = tasks
        return assignments
```

#### 2. Automated Project Estimation
```python
def estimate_project_complexity(breakdown):
    """Estimate project timeline based on role and task analysis"""
    role_weights = {
        "Frontend Developer": 2,
        "Backend Developer": 3,
        "AI/ML Engineer": 4,
        "Blockchain Developer": 5,
        "DevOps Engineer": 2
    }
    
    total_complexity = 0
    for role in breakdown["selected_roles"]:
        task_count = len(breakdown["role_tasks"].get(role, []))
        weight = role_weights.get(role, 2)
        total_complexity += task_count * weight
    
    return {
        "estimated_weeks": total_complexity // 5,
        "complexity_score": total_complexity,
        "team_size": len(breakdown["selected_roles"])
    }
```

## 🔧 Error Handling

The API provides comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages:

### Common Error Responses

}
```

#### 500 Internal Server Error - Processing Issues
```json
{
  "detail": "Error generating tasks: [specific error message]"
}
```
